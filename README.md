# Sentiment-Analysis
The sentiment analysis project is a Python-based project that allows users to enter any sentence or paragraph and analyzes the sentiment polarity of the text. It uses TextBlob, a Python-based library for processing textual data, to identify whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. The program then displays the result using a message box.
